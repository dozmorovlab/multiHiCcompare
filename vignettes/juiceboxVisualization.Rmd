# Introduction 

`multiHiCcompare` provides a method for detecting significant differentially interacting regions (DIRs) in Hi-C data. These DIRs are represented by pairs of genomic regions changing their interaction strength between conditions. It may be of interest for the user to visualize these DIRs on an interactive chromatin interaction heatmap in order to determine where they occur in relation to each other and to numerous genomic annotations. The `Juicebox` software provided by the Aiden Lab [https://www.aidenlab.org/](https://www.aidenlab.org/) can be used to visualize your Hi-C data and `multiHiCcompare` results. 

# Getting started

You will first need to download `Juicebox` from here: [https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox/wiki/Download](https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox/wiki/Download)

Once you have downloaded and installed `Juicebox` you may want to go through the provided tutorial here: [https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox/wiki/Visualization](https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox/wiki/Visualization)

If the Hi-C data you are analyzing was originally generated by the Aiden Lab, the data should be available in `Juicebox` by default. You will not need to perform any extra steps to open the heatmap, simply find your dataset under the `File > Open` menu in `Juicebox`. If your data was not originally generate by the Aiden Lab you will need to obtain it in the form of a `.hic` file. `.hic` files can be read into `Juicebox` using the `File > Open > Local...` menu. If your data is not in the form of a `.hic` file you will need to convert it to a `.hic` file. This can be done using the `Juicer tools` command `pre`. Instructions for this process can be found here: [https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre).

# Example 

For our example we will use the data from Rao 2017. We compared the data between the normal HCT-116 cells and the cells treated with auxin for 6 hours. The Rao 2017 data are available in `Juicebox` by default under `File > Open` menu, "Rao et al. | Cell 2017". You will want to select the main map for "Auxin treated (6 hrs)". You can also add a control map by choosing the "Rao et al. | Cell 2017" "Untreated" map. 

Assuming you have already analyzed the data using `multiHiCcompare` and you now have a `Hicexp` object containing the comparison results you can use the `exportJuicebox` function to export the list of DIRs as an annotations file for input into `Juicebox`. Say your `Hicexp` object is named `rao2017` simply run the following line of code in R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
exportJuicebox(rao2017, logfc_cutoff = 2, logcpm_cutoff = 1, p.adj_cutoff = 0.001, file_name = "rao2017Annotations.txt")
```

This function will create a text file in your working directory contianing the annotations which can then be imported into `Juicebox`. 

We have uploaded the annotation file to GitHub [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstansfield0/Rao2017Annotations/master/rao2017Annotations.txt) so that you can see the example yourself without re-running the analysis. Simply save the text file and you will be able to load in in `Juicebox`.

Next open `Juicebox` and load the Rao 2017 data. Now you can open the annotation file using the `View > show annotations panel > 2D annotations > add local` tab. The DIRs will appear as blue rectangles on the heatmap. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
githubURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstansfield0/Rao2017Annotations/master/juicebox.png"
download.file(githubURL,'juicebox.png', mode = 'wb')
```

Here we can see a screenshot of `Juicebox` with the Rao 2017 data loaded and our annotations visualized on the heatmap. The blue boxes on the heatmap represent the significant DIRs. You can zoom in or scroll around in the heatmap to better understand where the DIRs occur in relation to each other and on the chromatin map.
