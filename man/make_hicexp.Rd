\title{Make Hi-C experiment object from data}
\usage{
make_hicexp(..., data_list = NA, groups, covariates = NULL,
  remove_zeros = FALSE, zero.p = 0.8, A.min = 5, filter = TRUE,
  remove.regions = hg19_cyto)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Hi-C data. Data must in sparse upper triangular 
format with 4 columns: chr, region1, region2, IF or
in 7 column BEDPE format with columns chr, start1, 
end1, chr, start2, end2, IF.}

\item{data_list}{Alternate way to enter data. If you have
your Hi-C data in the form of a list already with each
entry of the list representing a sample use this option.}

\item{groups}{A vector of the experimental groups 
corresponding to each Hi-C data object entered.
If it is not in factor form when entered it will
be converted to a factor.}

\item{covariates}{Optional data.frame containing 
covariate information for your Hi-C experiment.
Some examples are enzyme used, batch number, etc.
Should have the same number of rows as the number
of Hi-C data objects entered and columns corresponding
to covariates.}

\item{remove_zeros}{Logical, should rows with 1 or more
zero IF values be removed?}

\item{zero.p}{The proportion of zeros in a row to filter by. 
If the proportion of zeros in a row is <= zero.p
the row will be filtered out, i.e. zero.p = 1 means
nothing is filtered based on zeros and zero.p = 0 
will filter rows that have any zeros.}

\item{A.min}{The minimum average expression value
(row mean) for an interaction pair. If the 
interaction pair has an average expression 
value less than A.min the row will be filtered
out.}

\item{filter}{Logical, should filtering be performed?
Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE it will filter out
the interactions that have low average IFs
or large numbers of 0 IF values. As these
interactions are not very interesting and
are commonly false positives during difference
detection it is better to remove them from
the dataset. Additionally, filtering will
help speed up the run time of multiHiCcompare. 
Filtering can be performed before or after 
normalization, however the best computational
speed gain will occur when filtering is done
before normalization. Filtering parameters
are controlled by the zero.p and A.min options.}

\item{remove.regions}{A GenomicRanges object indicating
specific regions to be filtered out. By default
this is the hg19 centromeric, gvar, and stalk
regions. Also included in the package is
hg38_cyto. If your data is not hg19 you will 
need to substitute this file. To choose not 
to filter any regions set regions = NULL. NOTE:
if you set filter = FALSE these regions will NOT
be removed. This occurs in conjuction with the 
filtering step.}

\value{
A hicexp object.

\description{
Make Hi-C experiment object from data
}
\details{
Use this function to create a hicexp object for
    analysis in multiHiCcompare. Filtering can also be 
    performed in this step if the filter option is 
    set to TRUE. Filtering parameters are controlled
    by the zero.p and A.min options.

# load data in sparse upper triangular format
data("HCT116_r1", "HCT116_r2", "HCT116_r3", "HCT116_r4", 
    "HCT116_r5", "HCT116_r6")
# make groups & covariate input
groups <- factor(c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))
covariates <- data.frame(enzyme = factor(c('mobi', 'mboi', 'mboi',
 'dpnii', 'dpnii', 'dpnii')), batch = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2))
# make the hicexp object
hicexp <- make_hicexp(HCT116_r1, HCT116_r2, HCT116_r3, HCT116_r4,
     HCT116_r5, HCT116_r6, groups = groups,
